<TITLE>John Paul Prays for Peace In Former War Zone in Syria</TITLE>
<CONTENT>Pouring water on a potted olive tree, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE> John Paul II</ROLE> prayed today for peace and forgiveness in the Middle East in a shattered city on the Golan Heights that is mainly a symbol of irreconcilable conflict.

The pocked streets surrounding the church where he prayed were crowded with thousands of Syrians brought by bus to greet <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE>. Many of them were former residents, who stood silently in front of their flattened houses.

The Golan Heights were captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Quneitra is in the portion that was returned in a 1974 agreement brokered by the United States. Syria has kept the city uninhabited and in ruins as a museum.

<ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> prayed that believers would ''find the courage to forgive one another so that the wounds of the past may be healed, and not be a pretext for further suffering in the present.''

But his very presence in Quneitra provided a striking showcase for the Syrian government's efforts to portray <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> as their ally against Israel. Syrian television covered the visit live, frequently cutting away from <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> to broadcast lingering close-ups of concrete rubble.

Weak and visibly tired, <ROLE>the 80-year-old <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> prayed on his knees inside the battered shell of an Orthodox church, one of the few buildings still standing, and addressed the news that a baby was killed this morning by Israeli tanks firing at a Palestinian refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.

''Mindful of the sad news of conflict and death that even today arrives from Gaza,'' <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> said in remarks added to his prepared text, ''our prayers become even more intense.''

<ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> was greeted by children holding up banners that signaled the political importance of his presence. ''We are so happy for your visit,'' one sign said. Another said, ''Right is on our side.''

In his travels <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> has always had to weave his message through the political agendas of his hosts, whether it was Gen. Augusto Pinochet in 1987 rearranging the schedule in Chile so he could pose on a balcony alongside <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE>, or Fidel Castro placing a portrait of Che Guevara above the altar where <POPE entity="">the pope</POPE> offered a Mass in Cuba in 1998.

The last time <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> was in the Middle East -- on another biblical pilgrimage, which took him to Israel and the Palestinian terrorities last year -- each side tried to use his presence as an implicit seal of approval for its claim to Jerusalem as a capital. The Vatican favors an international solution to protect the city's holy sites.

<ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE>, who feels he has the moral authority to transcend local political agendas, stuck to his message, unfazed by manipulative moments and ungracious statements on both sides.
The Vatican took no public note in Syria of President Bashar al-Assad's harsh statements seeking to portray Israel as the natural enemy of Christianity. At a Mass in a Damascus sports arena on Saturday, <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> instead urged Christians, Muslims and Jews to work together to combat intolerance.

His message today on the Golan Heights called for respect, justice and peace -- and also for enlightened leadership. ''In a special way we pray for the leaders of this noble land of Syria,'' the papal prayer stated. ''Grant them wisdom, farsightedness and perseverance.''

<ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> is on a six-day pilgrimage retracing the Apostle Paul's steps in Greece, Syria and Malta. Believers say he passed through Quneitra on his way to Damascus. Now this city is in a buffer zone administered by Syria but patrolled by United Nations peacekeeping troops.

''<ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> coming here means he supports our rights as Syrians and Arabs,'' said Metropolitan Saba Esper, a Syrian Orthodox cleric who was one of <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> hosts. ''It means the whole world will see the terrible destruction of the church and the city.''

The church where <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> prayed is shattered and empty, but its walls carry a two-page testimony by its former bishop, the Rev. George Muhassa, who said the destruction reminded him of Hiroshima.

Vatican aides appeared irritated by implications that <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> visit was being manipulated by his hosts. ''We couldn't care less about the propaganda,'' Joaqu√≠n Navarro-Valls, the papal spokesman, said in Quneitra. ''The majority of people in Syria and the Middle East very much appreciate the Holy Father's trip and also his prayers in this symbolic city. It is a very fitting place to pray for peace.''

On Sunday, <ROLE>John Paul became the first <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE> to visit a mosque</ROLE>. In Greece on Friday he apologized for the historic errors of his church toward Orthodox believers and was rewarded that night with a spontaneous moment of joint prayer that broke through centuries-old Orthodox taboos.

<ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE>, who turns 81 this month and whose ailments include tremors associated with Parkinson's disease, seemed wearied by the first four days of an arduous trip.

At the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, and again today in Quneitra, <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> read only a few paragraphs of his prepared prayer, letting an Arab translator deliver the bulk of his text.

On Tuesday <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> goes to Malta, where Paul was shipwrecked. It will be John Paul's third visit there. <ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> might have a chance to rest a little on that overwhelmingly Roman Catholic island before returning to Rome on Wednesday.</CONTENT></DOCUMENT>
