<EXTRAROLE>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman</EXTRAROLE> said yesterday that <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">QUEEN</HEADROLE> ELIZABETH II</ROLE> and other <EXTRAROLE>members of the royal family</EXTRAROLE> are discussing possible changes in <ROLE>Britain's 1,200-year-old <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING"> monarchy</HEADROLE></ROLE>. The palace refused to specify what issues <ROLE>the 70-year-old <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">queen</HEADROLE></ROLE>, her husband, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">PRINCE</HEADROLE> PHILIP</ROLE>, and the heir to the throne, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">PRINCE</HEADROLE> CHARLES</ROLE>, have taken up in their talks with senior aides.

The Sun said the discussions could lead to the end of payments from the public purse to <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Queen</HEADROLE></ROLE>, her husband and <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">QUEEN</HEADROLE> ELIZABETH the Queen Mother</ROLE>. Those payments amount to $13 million a year.

Instead of the public payments, they would want the $142 million a year in revenue generated by the Crown Estates, which <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">King</HEADROLE> George III</ROLE> surrendered in 1760, the newspaper said. 

The Sun reported that the royal family is also considering proposals to remove <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarch</HEADROLE> as temporal head of the Church of England</ROLE>, and to give women equal rights as heirs to the throne. Currently, <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarch</HEADROLE></ROLE> is succeeded by his or her eldest son, whose own son is next in line for <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">throne</HEADROLE></ROLE> before any of his sisters. Younger sons and their children are next in line, followed by any daughters of <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarch</HEADROLE></ROLE>.
