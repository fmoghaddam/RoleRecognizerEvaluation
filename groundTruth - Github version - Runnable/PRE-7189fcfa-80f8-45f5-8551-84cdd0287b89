<TITLE>The Front-Runner in Germany Runs Scared</TITLE>
<CONTENT>Three days before an election that has become unexpectedly suspenseful, Angela Merkel turned up on Thursday in this ancient city on the Rhine with a blunt message: <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">Chancellor</HEADROLE> Gerhard Schr√∂der</ROLE> has failed, and his government ought to be thrown out.

''A person who doesn't have the support of his own party can't put Germany on the right path,'' said Mrs. Merkel, who, as <EXTRAROLE>leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Union</EXTRAROLE>, is poised to achieve two firsts: <ROLE>the first woman to become German <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">chancellor</HEADROLE></ROLE> and the first former East German to lead the reunified country.

Mrs. Merkel, 51, is still likely to become <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">chancellor</HEADROLE></ROLE> after the vote on Sunday.

The Christian Democrats have given <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">chancellor</HEADROLE></ROLE> some easy targets, starting with a plan to raise the value-added tax to 18 percent, from 16 percent. 

She was initially praised for her boldness, but she has been forced to defend Mr. Kirchhof, to whom <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">chancellor</HEADROLE></ROLE> derisively refers as ''the professor from Heidelberg.''</CONTENT></DOCUMENT>
