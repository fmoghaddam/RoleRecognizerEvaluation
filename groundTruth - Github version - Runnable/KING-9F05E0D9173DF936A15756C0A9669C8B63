The British monarchy is just the ticket (www.royal.gov.uk).

The pages devoted to Diana, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Princess</HEADROLE> of Wales</ROLE>, are suitably prominent, reverential and respectful. The pages detailing a typical day in the life of <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">queen</HEADROLE></ROLE> depict a very wealthy, very earnest, very busy woman. 

There is enough data about castles, remodeling, acreage, equerries, swan upping, royal mews and <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">queen</HEADROLE></ROLE>'s beasts to put even the most ardent monarchist to sleep.

<ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Prince</HEADROLE> William</ROLE> began his education at Mrs. Mynor's Nursery School in September 1985, at age 3.

<ROLE>The last Welsh <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Prince</HEADROLE> of Wales</ROLE> was Llywelyn ap Gruffyd (1246-82).

Victoria's oldest child, <ROLE>Victoria, the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Princess</HEADROLE> Royal</ROLE>, was the mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II.

They are named <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Prince</HEADROLE> William</ROLE> and <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Prince</HEADROLE> Henry</ROLE>.

The best part of the royal site is the deep past, starting with <ROLE>the Anglo-Saxon <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">kings</HEADROLE> of Wessex</ROLE>. There are longer profiles of notable <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarchs</HEADROLE> like Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror, Henry VIII (who wrote a best seller defending the Roman Catholic Church, before all that marital unpleasantness changed things) and Charles I (he stammered)</ROLE>. 

But for incomparable mayhem, nothing beats the history of <ROLE>the Scottish <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">crown</HEADROLE></ROLE>. Here is a sample from 962 to 1005: Dubh was killed by Culen who was killed by Riderch, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">king</HEADROLE> of Strathclyde</ROLE>, whose daughter he had seized.

The speeches of some of its <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarchs</HEADROLE></ROLE> ring out from the site.

Elizabeth I to her army on the eve of the Spanish Armada: I know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of <ROLE>a <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">king</HEADROLE></ROLE> -- and of <ROLE>a <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">king</HEADROLE> of England</ROLE>, too.

James I proclaims an attitude:  <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Kings</HEADROLE></ROLE> are justly called gods, for that they exercise a manner of resemblance of divine power on earth.

A member of Parliament at the time of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, on the importance of making William and Mary and <ROLE>future <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarchs</HEADROLE></ROLE> financially dependent on the legislative body: When <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">princes</HEADROLE></ROLE> have not needed money, they have not needed us.</CONTENT>
