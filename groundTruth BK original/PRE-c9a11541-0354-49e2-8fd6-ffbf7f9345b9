GEORGE BUSH

<ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE> Bush</ROLE> used an attack on his honesty by <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">Gov.</HEADROLE> Bill Clinton</ROLE> as an occasion to mount his sharpest assault yet on his rival's fitness for office. He denounced Mr. Clinton for accusing him of repeatedly lying about his knowledge of the Iran arms-for-hostage affair in 1986. <ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE> -- on the third stop of a train trip through Wisconsin intended to project an image of confidence and momentum -- then unleashed a scorching recital of what he called Mr. Clinton's deceptions and reversals on seven issues, including his draft history, his use of marijuana and his positions on free trade, right-to-work laws and the Persian Gulf war. BILL CLINTON

<ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">Gov.</HEADROLE> Bill Clinton</ROLE> returned to <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE> Bush</ROLE>'s base in the South and accused him of appealing to regional prejudice with a message that changes as he moves around the country. "In one state he says I'm too liberal," <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">Governor</HEADROLE> Clinton</ROLE> said in Georgia. "In another state he says I'm a backwater redneck." The Clinton campaign's biggest fight remains in the North, where he has been spending considerable time working for votes in New Jersey, Ohio and Michigan, but Mr. Clinton's aides said they returned to Georgia in part because they needed to win there and in part because winning the state has become a point of personal pride. ROSS PEROT

Kicking off his only extensive campaign swing, Ross Perot harshly criticized both of his rivals. He ridiculed the notion that <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">Gov.</HEADROLE> Bill Clinton</ROLE>'s leadership in Arkansas had prepared him for the White House, but he made his most blistering attacks against <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE> Bush. At a rally of 8,000 supporters at the University of South Florida, he charged Mr. Bush with ignoring the savings and loan crisis, permitting the rise of Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama and propping up Saddam Hussein in Iraq. And while he continued to assert he would win Tuesday's election, he seemed as interested in making sure that Mr. Bush did not. ON TELEVISION
