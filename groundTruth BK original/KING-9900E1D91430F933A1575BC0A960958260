A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said yesterday that <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">QUEEN</HEADROLE> ELIZABETH II</ROLE> and other <EXTRAROLE>members of the royal family</EXTRAROLE> are discussing possible changes in Britain's 1,200-year-old monarchy. The palace refused to specify what issues <ROLE>the 70-year-old <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">queen</HEADROLE></ROLE>, her husband, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">PRINCE</HEADROLE> PHILIP</ROLE>, and <ROLE>the heir to the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">throne</HEADROLE></ROLE>, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">PRINCE</HEADROLE> CHARLES</ROLE>, have taken up in their talks with senior aides.

A tabloid newspaper, The Sun, reported that they include ending the public financing of royalty, modernizing the rules on who succeeds to the throne and allowing royalty to marry Roman Catholics.

''The discussion of strategic issues goes on regularly in this as in other organizations,'' said a spokeswoman for the palace, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.

The Sun said the discussions could lead to the end of payments from the public purse to <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">Queen</HEADROLE></ROLE>, her husband and <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">QUEEN</HEADROLE> ELIZABETH the Queen Mother</ROLE>. Those payments amount to $13 million a year.

But <EXTRAROLE>the royal family members</EXTRAROLE> aren't exactly planning to take night jobs. Instead of the public payments, they would want the $142 million a year in revenue generated by the Crown Estates, which <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">King</HEADROLE> George III</ROLE> surrendered in 1760, the newspaper said. George III agreed to give up income from the estates in return for a sum from the public purse determined by Parliament.

The Sun reported that <EXTRAROLE>the royal family</EXTRAROLE> is also considering proposals to remove <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarch</HEADROLE> as temporal head of the Church of England></ROLE>, and to give women equal rights as <ROLE>heirs to the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">throne</HEADROLE></ROLE>. Currently, <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarch</HEADROLE></ROLE> is succeeded by his or her eldest son, whose own son is next in line for <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">throne</HEADROLE></ROLE> before any of his sisters. Younger sons and their children are next in line, followed by <ROLE>any daughters of the <HEADROLE entity="" type="KING">monarch</HEADROLE></ROLE>.

Among the most significant of the changes reported to be under consideration is a proposal to let royalty marry Roman Catholics without losing their position in the line of succession.
