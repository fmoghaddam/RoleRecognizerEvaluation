<TITLE>Clinton on Abortion: Then, and Now</TITLE>
<CONTENT>To the Editor:

In "Who Can Defeat Bill Clinton?" (column, Feb. 13), A. M. Rosenthal crafts an insightful sentence: "Mr. Clinton's danger is that he will lose the undecided who can accept an <ROLE>occasionally inconsistent <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE> but not a consistently inconstant one."

Mr. Clinton's major adversary may be his own inconstancy. One overlooked example is his approach to limited abortion.

In a 1993 speech in Chillicothe, Ohio, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE> Clinton</ROLE> said: "Very few Americans believe that all abortions all the time are all right. Almost all Americans believe that abortions should be illegal when the children can live outside the mother's womb."

It would seem these Clintonian musings aptly apply to a late-term procedure called partial-birth abortion, a ban on which has passed Congress. If signed by <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE>, the bill would outlaw a horrible method for killing viable, late-term children (Mr. Clinton's word).

Yet despite the support for this bill, <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE> Clinton</ROLE> has vowed to veto it. Why? Perhaps he forgot what he said in Chillicothe. Or maybe he is not ready to oppose infanticide.
