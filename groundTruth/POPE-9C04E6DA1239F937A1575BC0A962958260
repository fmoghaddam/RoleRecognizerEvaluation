<TITLE>Pope's Health Is Prompting New Concern</TITLE>
<CONTENT>ROME, Aug. 23â€” The Vatican insisted today that <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE> John Paul II</ROLE> was making excellent progress during a vacation in the mountains of northern Italy, despite concern over his health and questions about the potential hazards of the visit he plans to Sarajevo.

The worries about <ROLE>the 74-year-old <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> physical well-being resurfaced on Sunday when he seemed to grimace in pain while descending from a platform after he had said Mass.

At the time, his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> had inadvertently put all his weight on his right leg, which was injured last April when he fell in his bathroom at the Vatican. His right femur was broken and he underwent bone replacement surgery.

While <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> leg is clinically healed from the operation, Mr. Navarro-Valls said, he still has difficulty walking and usually places more weight on his uninjured left leg. This time, without thinking about it, he put all his weight on the part of his leg that had been operated, Mr. Navarro-Valls said. But he ended up joking about it. New Speculation

The explanation did little to prevent a renewed series of press reports here suggesting that <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> health was worse than the Vatican was prepared to acknowledge.

In the last two years, <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE>, who survived a 1981 assassination attempt, has undergone surgery to remove a large tumor from his intestines and dislocated his right shoulder when he tripped while descending from his throne during an audience last November.

The Vatican has vigorously denied reports suggesting that <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> suffers from blackouts and that his health problems relate to Parkinson's disease or bone marrow cancer.

Although <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> began his annual mountain holiday last week looking pale and tired, Mr. Navarro-Valls again rejected suggestions that <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> was sick, describing him as "basically healthy, strong and vigorous."

Since then, the Vatican has issued daily bulletins chronicling <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> walks in the mountains as evidence of his well-being. Confirming the excellent recovery of the Holy Father, his mountain excursions are continuing, Vatican Radio said today, reporting that <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> had pressed himself to take longer walks. His walks, however, seem to be less ambitious than in previous years. Riskiest of His Trips

The Vatican has insisted, moreover, that <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE> John Paul II</ROLE> is still planning to visit Sarajevo on Sept. 8 on a one-day trip that seems to be the riskiest of the many voyages he has undertaken during his 16-year papacy.

He is continuing to prepare himself intensively for the visit to Sarajevo, Mr. Navarro-Valls said today. <ROLE>The <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> is planning to deliver a speech at the Bosnian capital's Olympic skating stadium. Two days later, he is planning a separate trip to Zagreb, the Croatian capital.

The idea of <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> visiting a city where his plane could be shot down or he himself could come under direct fire has drawn concern from United Nations officials, particularly since Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has said <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> safety cannot be guaranteed.

The warning has been echoed by Metropolitan Jovan, the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who said such a visit would be fraught with risks.

While <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> has frequently inveighed against the bloodletting in the former Yugoslavia, he has not physically visited the Balkan war zones, where fighting has been under way for more than three years. Visit to Lebanon Canceled

Vatican officials have balanced their forecasts that the visit to Sarajevo will go ahead with hints that it could be called off at the last moment if <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> feels his audience in the stadium is at risk. He used the same reason to cancel a visit to Lebanon this year after bomb explosions in a Maronite Christian Church.

The only way <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> could enter Sarajevo by air would be along the flight path used by United Nations relief flights, which are frequently suspended because of antiaircraft fire. Mr. Karazdic has suggested that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces could try to shoot down the Pope's plane and then blame the Bosnian Serbs. And once he is in the city, <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE>, who is considered by many Serbs to have supported their adversaries, would be in range of sniper fire.

Bosnia has a relatively small Roman Catholic population, but Serbian Orthodox Christians have not forgotten that the Vatican quickly recognized the independence of their foes in Roman Catholic Slovenia and Croatia in January 1992.

Mr. Navarro-Valls, <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> spokesman, sought to rule out the idea that, if the Sarajevo trip was canceled, it would be because of <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE>'s</ROLE> poor health.

That leg, which by the way is clinically healed, will not be the thing which prevents <ROLE>the <HEADROLE entity="" type="POPE">Pope</HEADROLE></ROLE> from going to Sarajevo, he said today.</CONTENT></DOCUMENT>
