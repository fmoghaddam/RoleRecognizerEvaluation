<TITLE>How to Understand Bush's Attacks on Clinton; Can He Send Others?</TITLE>
<CONTENT>To the Editor:

Gov. Bill Clinton is not the only person who had mixed feelings about the Vietnam War. Like thousands of other young men, I served during that war, and I understand what Bill Clinton went through as a young man more than two decades ago.

However, what makes his position unusual is that now he wants to be <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE> and become our <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">Commander in Chief</HEADROLE></ROLE>. Therefore, the big question is this: How could Bill Clinton as <ROLE><HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE> justify sending young men to war, for any reason, when he did everything possible not to go himself?
