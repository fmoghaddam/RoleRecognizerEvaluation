<TITLE>Media Talk; The Winner: Bill Clinton (Abridged)</TITLE>
<CONTENT>The votes are in, and the winner for best performer in the role of <ROLE>former <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE> Bill Clinton</ROLE> is: Bill Clinton.

Mr. Clinton was honored in absentia on Friday night at the Audies, the Audiobook Publishers Association's version of the Oscars. He had been nominated for his reading of a 6.5-hour abridged version of his autobiography, ''My Life.'' A full-length, 51.5-hour version on 41 CD's, read by Michael Beck, was a finalist in a category for unabridged works. The dueling nominations illustrated a nagging question among audiobook devotees: Should authors record their own books, or defer to bona fide voice talent?

Mr. Clinton scored one for the authors. He won the ''Audiobook of the Year'' award, while the unabridged version was snubbed.

Jacob Bronstein, who with Dan Zitt produced and directed the abridged version, said that while directing requires assertiveness, with Mr. Clinton ''it was more difficult to assert myself than with a regular Broadway actor.'' Mr. Bronstein said feedback went something like: ''<ROLE>Mr. <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE>, can you move closer to the mike?'' Or, ''This is an important passage, <ROLE>Mr. <HEADROLE entity="" type="PRESIDENT">President</HEADROLE></ROLE>; maybe you can try to imbue it with some of that feeling you were using in Chapter 2?''

Mr. Beck, who narrated most of John Grisham's audiobooks and was raised in Arkansas and Tennessee, said in an interview from Los Angeles that he had chosen a ''generic Arkansas dialect'' rather than a '''Saturday Night Live' version of Bill Clinton.''

Mr. Bronstein said Mr. Clinton had selected Mr. Beck from among 10 audition tapes. Not that Mr. Beck ever did him any favors: He voted against Mr. Clinton in both presidential elections. ''I'm a dyed-in-the-wool conservative,'' Mr. Beck said. ''But as an actor, to the best of my creative ability, I spoke those words as Bill Clinton intended them to be spoken. I've played murderers, but I didn't go out and kill people.'' ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN</CONTENT></DOCUMENT>
